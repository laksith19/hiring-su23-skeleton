# CS61BL Summer 2023 Hiring - OH Simulation 

This repo contains code that will be used for round 1 of CS61BL Summer 2023 interviews. You can find the lab spec on the old course [website](https://github.com/laksith19/hiring-su23-skeleton)

## Setup Intructions

1. Clone the respository locally `git clone https://github.com/cs61bl/hiring-su23-skeleton.git`
1. Set SDK to Java 17+ and ensure that the language level is set to SDK default. 
1. Intellij should auto-import the necessary libraries but if it didn't recogonize them on your end, add the `lib` directory to the project libraries.
